Monokai Colorscheme for Gnome Terminal
======================================

Scripts for setting the Monokai colorscheme in Gnome Terminal.

Forked from [Gnome Terminal colors Solarized](https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized)

Installation
------------

To be able to uninstall, I recommend that you create a new Gnome Terminalprofile, using the menu in Gnome Terminal.

You need the `dconf` command (if you run a recent Gnome version). With Ubuntu,
this can be installed by running

    $ sudo apt-get install dconf-cli

Then clone the repository and you can run the installation script:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jesusdanielcf/monokai-gnome-terminal
    $ cd monokai-gnome-terminal
    $ ./install.sh
And just follow the instructions.
